6. **display**: 
   - **Value**: "standalone"
   - **Purpose**: Indicates how your application will be displayed to the user. Possible values:
     - **fullscreen**: The app occupies the entire screen.
     - **standalone**: The app looks like a native app, without visible browser elements.
     - **minimal-ui**: Minimal browser user interface.
     - **browser**: The app opens like a regular website in a browser.

7. **orientation**: 
   - **Value**: "portrait-primary"
   - **Purpose**: Specifies the preferred orientation for your application. In this case, it is portrait orientation.

8. **background_color**: 
   - **Value**: "#fff"
   - **Purpose**: The background color displayed while your application is loading.

9. **theme_color**: 
   - **Value**: "#3f51b5"
   - **Purpose**: The theme color of your application. This can affect the color of the browser's address bar and other UI elements.

10. **description**: 
    - **Value**: "A simple Instagram Clone, implementing a lot of PWA for students ZIEIT"
    - **Purpose**: A brief description of your application. Used to provide information to users and for SEO.

11. **dir**: 
    - **Value**: "ltr"
    - **Purpose**: Indicates the text direction in the application. In this case, the text will be displayed from left to right.

12. **lang**: 
    - **Value**: "en-US"
    - **Purpose**: Specifies the language of the application. In this case, it is English (US).

Linking the manifest file informs the browser about the existence of the PWA and how to properly handle it.

**2.Analyze the characteristics of the event**

This code sets up the core events for a service worker: `install`, `activate`, and `fetch`. Let's break down each event and its characteristics:

### 1. `install` Event

```javascript
self.addEventListener("install", event => {
    console.log("Service Workers installing... ", event);
    event.waitUntil(
        caches.open("static").then(cache => {
            console.log("Service Workers Precache...", cache);
            cache.add("/src/js/app.js");
        })
    );
});
```

#### Characteristics:

- **Purpose**: This event fires when the service worker is being installed. It's typically used to cache static resources.
- **`event.waitUntil`**: Delays the completion of the install event until the provided promise resolves. In this case, it opens a cache and adds the `app.js` file to it.
- **`caches.open("static")`**: Opens a cache named "static".
- **`cache.add("/src/js/app.js")`**: Adds the `app.js` file to the cache.

### 2. `activate` Event

```javascript
self.addEventListener("activate", event => {
    console.log("Activating Service Workers ", event);
    return self.clients.claim();
});
```

#### Characteristics:

- **Purpose**: This event fires when the service worker is activated. It's typically used to perform tasks related to updating, such as clearing old caches.
- **`self.clients.claim()`**: Immediately takes control of all client pages without requiring them to reload.

### 3. `fetch` Event

```javascript
self.addEventListener("fetch", event => {
    event.respondWith(
        caches.match(event.request).then(response => {
            if (response) {
                return response;
            } else {
                return fetch(event.request);
            }
        })
    );
});
```

#### Characteristics:

- **Purpose**: This event fires for every HTTP request made by the page that is being served by this service worker. It is used to provide caching for requests and responses.
- **`event.respondWith`**: Intercepts the request and provides an alternate response.
- **`caches.match(event.request)`**: Looks for a matching request in the cache.
- **Response Logic**:
  - If a matching response is found in the cache (the `response` variable), it returns that response.
  - If no match is found in the cache, it performs a network request `fetch(event.request)`.

### Summary

- **`install`**: Caches necessary resources when the service worker is being installed.
- **`activate`**: Takes control of client pages immediately upon activation.
- **`fetch`**: Provides caching functionality by intercepting requests and serving them from the cache if available.

These events form the foundation for caching and managing network requests in a PWA, enhancing the performance and reliability of the application.

**Explore the CacheStorage interface (https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage) and Cache (https://developer.mozilla.org/ua/docs/Web/API/Cache).**

#### CacheStorage
**CacheStorage** is a global object that provides access to the cache storage within the context of service workers. It allows creating, opening, and deleting caches, which can store requests and responses, thus helping to improve the performance of web applications.

Key methods:
- **`open(cacheName)`**: Creates or opens a cache with the specified name.
- **`delete(cacheName)`**: Deletes a cache with the specified name.
- **`keys()`**: Returns a list of all caches.
- **`match(request)`**: Searches for a request across all caches and returns the matching response.

#### Cache
**Cache** is an object representing a single cache. It provides methods for adding, retrieving, and deleting requests and responses from that cache.

Key methods:
- **`add(request)`**: Adds a request and its corresponding response to the cache.
- **`addAll(requests)`**: Adds multiple requests and their responses to the cache.
- **`put(request, response)`**: Explicitly stores the response for a given request.
- **`match(request)`**: Searches for a request in the cache and returns the matching response.
- **`delete(request)`**: Removes a request and its response from the cache.
